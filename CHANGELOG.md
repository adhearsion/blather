# [develop](https://github.com/adhearsion/blather/compare/master...develop)
  * jabber:client and jabber:component:accept namespaces are no longer erased when parsing, so if you manually select nodes assuming there will be no namespace for these, you need to update
  * Breaking change (for release in v3.0.0): Falsy handler return value no longer causes passing to the next handler. Use `pass` explicitly for that.
  * Breaking change (for release in v3.0.0): Blather::Client uses EM.defer instead of sucker_punch for threadpool, or else no threads when passed async: true
  * Bugfix: Blather::Stanza::X#find_or_create only looks at immediate children of parent now
  * Feature: Blather::Stanza::X::Field values can be arrays to support multiple-valued fields
  * Feature: Add Blather::Stanza::Iq::IBR to implement XEP-0077 In-Band Registration
  * Bugfix: Starttls when offered by server; including when the unsecured stream features start with a <method>
  * Bugfix: Parser does not drop attribute namespaces

  * Fix the load error related to not pushing Blather's dir into the load path

# v0.3.2
  * Switch the push parser from chunking to streaming.
  * Don't push Blather's dir into the load paths

# v0.3.1
  * Small changes to the DSL due to handler collisions:
    "status" -> "set_status"
    "roster" -> "my_roster"
  * Small changes to the Blather::Client API to keep it feeling more like EM's API:
    #stream_started -> #post_init
    #call -> #receive_data
    #stop -> #close
    #stopped -> #unbind
  * Refactored some of the code internal to Blather::Client

# v0.3.0

  * Added Hash with Array guard
  * Added a hirrarchy printer to examples directory
  * Moved Disco to be in the Stanza namespace (staves off deeply namespaced classes)
  * Namespaced the DSL methods to Blather::DSL. These can be included in any object you like now. "require 'blather/client'" will still include them directly in Kernel to keep the simple one-file dsl
  * Stopped doing one class per error type. This created a giant hierarchy tree that was just unnecessary. The error name is now #name. Errors can be matched with a combination of handler and guard.
  * Fixed XML namespaces. Previous versions weren't actually adding the node to the namespace making xpath queries inconsistent at best.
  * Added support for anonymous authentication by providing a blank node on the jid ("@[host]")

# v0.2.3
  * Go back to using the master branch for gems (stupid mistake)

# v0.2.2
  * Switch to Jeweler.
  * Move from custom libxml to just a custom push parser
  * Add guards to handlers

# v0.2.1 Upgrade to libxml 0.9.7

# v0.2 Overhaul the DSL to look more like Sinatra

# v0.1 Initial release (birth!)
