  # # Presence Stanza
  #
  # [RFC 3921 Section 2.2 - Presence Syntax](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html#stanzas-presence)
  #
  # Within Blather most of the interaction with Presence stanzas will be
  # through one of its child classes: Status or Subscription.
  #
  # Presence stanzas are used to express an entity's current network
  # availability (offline or online, along with various sub-states of the
  # latter and optional user-defined descriptive text), and to notify other
  # entities of that availability. Presence stanzas are also used to negotiate
  # and manage subscriptions to the presence of other entities.
  #
  # ## "Type" Attribute
  #
  # The `type` attribute of a presence stanza is optional. A presence stanza
  # that does not possess a `type` attribute is used to signal to the server
  # that the sender is online and available for communication. If included,
  # the `type` attribute specifies a lack of availability, a request to manage
  # a subscription to another entity's presence, a request for another
  # entity's current presence, or an error related to a previously-sent
  # presence stanza. If included, the `type` attribute must have one of the
  # following values:
  #
  # * `:unavailable` -- Signals that the entity is no longer available for
  #   communication
  #
  # * `:subscribe` -- The sender wishes to subscribe to the recipient's
  #   presence.
  #
  # * `:subscribed` -- The sender has allowed the recipient to receive their
  #   presence.
  #
  # * `:unsubscribe` -- The sender is unsubscribing from another entity's
  #   presence.
  #
  # * `:unsubscribed` -- The subscription request has been denied or a
  #   previously-granted subscription has been cancelled.
  #
  # * `:probe` -- A request for an entity's current presence; should be
  #   generated only by a server on behalf of a user.
  #
  # * `:error` -- An error has occurred regarding processing or delivery of a
  #   previously-sent presence stanza.
  #
  # Blather provides a helper for each possible type:
  #
  #     Presence#unavailabe?
  #     Presence#unavailable?
  #     Presence#subscribe?
  #     Presence#subscribed?
  #     Presence#unsubscribe?
  #     Presence#unsubscribed?
  #     Presence#probe?
  #     Presence#error?
  #
  # Blather treats the `type` attribute like a normal ruby object attribute
  # providing a getter and setter. The default `type` is nil.
  #
  #     presence = Presence.new
  #     presence.type                # => nil
  #     presence.type = :unavailable
  #     presence.unavailable?        # => true
  #     presence.error?              # => false
  #
  #     presence.type = :invalid   # => RuntimeError
  #
