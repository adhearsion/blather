module Blather

  # # A pure XMPP stream.
  #
  # Blather::Stream can be used to build your own handler system if Blather's
  # doesn't suit your needs. It will take care of the entire connection
  # process then start sending Stanza objects back to the registered client.
  #
  # The client you register with Blather::Stream needs to implement the following
  # methods:
  # * #post_init(stream, jid = nil)
  #   Called after the stream has been initiated.
  #   @param [Blather::Stream] stream is the connected stream object
  #   @param [Blather::JID, nil] jid is the full JID as recognized by the server
  #
  # * #receive_data(stanza)
  #   Called every time the stream receives a new stanza
  #   @param [Blather::Stanza] stanza a stanza object from the server
  #
  # * #unbind
  #   Called when the stream is shutdown. This will be called regardless of which
  #   side shut the stream down.
  #
  # @example Create a new stream and handle it with our own class
  #     class MyClient
  #       attr :jid
  #
  #       def post_init(stream, jid = nil)
  #         @stream = stream
  #         self.jid = jid
  #         p "Stream Started"
  #       end
  #
  #       # Pretty print the stream
  #       def receive_data(stanza)
  #         pp stanza
  #       end
  #
  #       def unbind
  #         p "Stream Ended"
  #       end

  #         @stream.write what
